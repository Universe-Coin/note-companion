# Self-Hosting AI in Obsidian: Get Private, Fast AI Assistance in 30 Minutes

## Why Self-Hosting AI Is Worth Considering for Obsidian

AI is transforming how we work with notes, but sending your private thoughts and research to a third-party cloud service isn’t always appealing. Many Obsidian users want AI-powered workflows—summaries, auto-tagging, smart suggestions—but hesitate due to privacy, cost, or wanting more control.

What if you could get the best of both worlds? Self-hosting AI in Obsidian is more accessible than you might think. With the right approach, you can have a functional, private setup running in under 30 minutes—no server rack or advanced coding skills required. If you are still weighing local vs cloud, see [choosing between cloud and self-hosted AI for your vault](/blog/choosing-between-cloud-and-self-hosted-ai-for-your-vault) and [why your second brain should be local-first](/blog/why-your-second-brain-should-be-local-first).

## What Does Self-Hosting AI Actually Give You?

Before you dive in, it’s worth understanding why local AI is so appealing for Obsidian users:

- **Full privacy:** Your notes never leave your device. AI processing happens entirely on your laptop or desktop.
- **No surprise charges:** You avoid the unpredictability of pay-per-use APIs and subscription fees.
- **Tailored experience:** Choose models and tweak parameters to fit your note-taking style and hardware.

Self-hosting isn’t about building models from scratch. It’s about running a lean, efficient local AI that plugs into your favorite Obsidian workflows—giving you fast, secure, and customizable assistance without the cloud.

## Minimal Self-Hosted AI: Your 30-Minute Workflow

Ready to see how simple it can be? Here’s a practical step-by-step guide to getting your own local AI assistant working with Obsidian, even if you’re not a developer.

### 1. Pick a Lightweight Local AI Model

Start by selecting a model designed for efficiency:

- For most laptops, look at [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or other small open-source LLMs (think 7B or smaller).
- These models don’t require a GPU and can run with minimal setup.

### 2. Set Up a Quick Local API Wrapper

You need a way for Obsidian to talk to your AI. Use a simple HTTP API wrapper:

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) are popular Python choices.
- Many community projects offer ready-made scripts—search for “llama.cpp API wrapper” to find one that suits your OS.

### 3. Connect Your Obsidian AI Plugin

Most AI plugins for Obsidian allow you to specify a custom API endpoint:

- In your plugin’s settings, point at your local server’s base URL (often `http://localhost:8000`). The full path—such as `/api/v1/generate`—depends on your wrapper; use whatever URL your API docs or plugin examples specify.
- Adjust model parameters (temperature, context window) as needed for your workflow.

### 4. Run a Test Prompt

Open Obsidian, pick a note, and trigger an AI command:

- Try “Summarize this note” or “Suggest tags” to check if your setup works.
- Your responses should be fast and processed locally.

### 5. Automate Organization with AI

With your local AI running, start using it for:

- Tag recommendations for new notes.
- Folder suggestions based on content.
- Even basic linking or structure suggestions, depending on your plugin’s features.

If you want to supplement your local model with additional perspectives, you can enable cloud-based AI suggestions (like those in Note Companion) while keeping sensitive work entirely local.

## Real-World Scenario: Researcher’s Private AI Workflow

Meet Maria, a grad student compiling sensitive research in Obsidian. She’s keen on AI summaries but can’t send confidential data to the cloud.

Here’s how Maria gets started:

1. Downloads and installs `llama.cpp` with a compact LLaMA model.
2. Launches a Python FastAPI wrapper that creates a simple local API.
3. In Obsidian, she configures her AI plugin to use `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/generate`—the path her FastAPI wrapper exposes.
4. With her `inbox/paper-notes.md` open, she asks the AI to summarize key points.
5. She enables AI-suggested tags, like `#research` or `#methodology`, which are added automatically.

Within half an hour, Maria has a private AI assistant that helps distill insights and organize her vault—no subscriptions, no privacy worries.

## Minimal Setup Checklist

- [ ] Select a lightweight local LLM (e.g., llama.cpp or similar).
- [ ] Install and launch a local API wrapper (FastAPI or Flask).
- [ ] Point your Obsidian AI plugin to your local API endpoint.
- [ ] Run a test command (summarize, tag) in Obsidian.
- [ ] Enable AI-based organization (tags, folders, or links) as desired.

## What a Minimal Self-Hosted Setup Won’t Do

Self-hosting brings meaningful benefits, but it’s not a silver bullet for every AI need:

- **Heavy-duty models:** Large LLMs (13B+) or GPU-optimized variants require more time and hardware.
- **Training or fine-tuning:** Customizing models with your own data is a separate, more advanced project.
- **Team collaboration:** Real-time, multi-user AI assistance still requires careful sync or cloud tools.

But for most solo Obsidian users, this lean setup covers 80% of AI workflows—summaries, tagging, and organization—without extra baggage.

## Blending Local and Cloud: Using Note Companion

If you want to combine the strengths of local and cloud AI, consider layering [Note Companion](https://www.notecompanion.ai) into your setup:

- Use Note Companion’s AI organization suggestions to get folder and tag ideas beyond your local model’s training data.
- Rely on Note Companion’s Inbox auto-organization for initial capture, then refine with your private AI.

This hybrid approach gives you maximum privacy for sensitive notes while still tapping into broader AI context or suggestions when you choose.

## Wrapping Up: Private AI in Obsidian, No Headaches

You don’t need to be an engineer to self-host AI for Obsidian. With a lightweight model, a simple API, and a quick plugin config, you’ll have real AI-powered workflows—summaries, tags, organization—in under 30 minutes.

It’s a simple route to privacy, savings, and control, all while staying deeply integrated with Obsidian. Try it out this week and see how much easier it is to keep your vault organized, insightful, and secure—and when you want cloud help on your own terms, [Note Companion](https://www.notecompanion.ai) can sit alongside your local stack.
